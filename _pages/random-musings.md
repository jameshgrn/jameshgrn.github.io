# Open Notes & Ideas

This is a collection of notes, ideas, and work-in-progress thoughts from my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vault. These documents are often drafted and refined with the help of Large Language Models (LLMs).

⚠️ **Note**: These are living documents that I work on publicly. They may contain:
- Incomplete thoughts
- Work-in-progress ideas
- Potential inaccuracies

## Current Notes


### Mathematical & Physical Models

- [Derivation Of Softmax Random Walk Algorithm](/random-musings/derivation-of-softmax-random-walk-algorithm)

I believe in working in public and sharing ideas early. Feel free to explore!
