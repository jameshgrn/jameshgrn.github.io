## James H. Gearon
Earth and Atmospheric Sciences  
Indiana University

You can download my full CV as a PDF [here](/pdf/Gearon_James_CV.pdf).

My research focuses on how sedimentary landscapes organize and reorganize across scales, investigating patterns, thresholds, and transitions that emerge from fundamental physical processes. I specialize in geospatial data engineering and applied data science approaches to geomorphology and sedimentology.
