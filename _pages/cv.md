**Ph.D. in Geological Sciences**, Indiana University (July 2025)

My research focuses on how sedimentary landscapes organize and reorganize across scales, investigating patterns, thresholds, and transitions that emerge from fundamental physical processes. I specialize in geospatial data engineering and applied data science approaches to geomorphology and sedimentology.
