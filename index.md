## Current Projects
### Sedimentology 
[Master's Project: Facies Character and Morphology of an Eocene Terminal Splay Complex, Uinta Basin, Utah](/Uinta)
<img src="images/uintachannel.jpg"/>
**Project description:** Lacustrine deltas call for careful interpretation as they are distinct from their marine
counterparts. Lacustrine delta-fronts are dominated by shallow, low-relief sandy channels which drive sheet-sand
deposition basin-ward. Furthermore, lake base level can change meters over short time scales (100s of years
) leading to high-frequency progradational and retrogradational sequences. The Sunnyside Delta Interval—200m
interval of 10 fluvio-lacustrine sequences (Keighley et al., 2002 & 2003)—of the Middle Green River Fm. has been
thoroughly studied but the nature of the sediment delivery mechanism to Eocene Lake Uinta remains hotly debated in
the literature. Previous workers have classified the interval as a Fluvially-Dominated Delta (Remy, 1991; Schomacker
 et al., 2010), a Fluvial Fan (Wang, 2019), and a Terminal Splay (Pusca Doctoral Thesis, 2003). I believe that the
 Sunnyside Delta Interval most resembles a Terminal Splay Complex (after Fisher et al., 2008) based on facies
 character and morphology.

### Remote Sensing
[Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP) Winter 2020 Grant (PI): Creating a Public Database of Global Lake Water
 Levels ](/pdf/ESIP_Proposal_2020_Gearon_Fuka.pdf)
<img src="images/ESIP_Lakes_Cover.jpg"/>
**Project description:** There are many publicly available lake-level data sets in varying states of accessibility
, upkeep, and accuracy (USGS, HydroWeb, Copernicus Global Land Service, NASA, NOAA, and various publications). The
collating of data from disparate sources, or data-wrangling, is often the barrier to entry for many scienific
 projects. _Lake water level data particularly suffers from lack of ease of access as it is distributed haphazardly
 across federal, state, and academic databases._ ESIP, AWS, and I are collaborating to provide an open-source, well
 documented, scalable, modular, and regularly updated database of lake water levels and a python package of
 lacustrine analysis tools for use by researchers across disciplines and institutions. Removing hurdles between researchers and available data is imperative in an increasingly data-rich world. Many researchers have immense subject-matter expertise regarding the biological, hydrological, and sedimentological nuances of lacustrine environments but little or no experience in automated querying, data cleaning/wrangling, or programming.

[Geomorphic Controls on Shrub Canopy Size and Spacing of Creosote Bush in Northern Mojave Desert, USA](/BCCE)
<img src="images/BoulderCity.jpg"/>
This manuscript is currently in revision (_Landscape Ecology_) and will be available hopefully before 2021!<br>
**Project Abstract**<br><br>
**Context** - Studies on the role of geomorphology on vegetation structure at the basin scale are rarely available
 and less likely in the future due to access, funding, and potential health risks. <br>
**Objectives** - Our goal is to determine the primary abiotic controlling factor(s) on shrub canopy architecture. We
 posit that landscape position and local-scale geomorphic features in a desert alluvial fan environment will
  influence canopy volume and shrub spacing of creosote bush Larrea tridentata. <br>
**Methods** - We use previously identified locations and selected characteristics (canopy volume, and spatial
 distribution) of approximately 23 million individual shrubs located in Eldorado Valley, Nevada, USA. We relate these
  characteristics to aspect, slope, and geomorphic surfaces at each shrub location. <br>
**Results** - Aspect and surface age have demonstrable influences on both shrub canopy volume and shrub spacing for
 all 5 geomorphic surfaces studied, with the highest median canopy volumes on east-facing surface (0.758m3) almost 5X
  larger than the lowest median volumes (0.152m3) on the WNW-facing surfaces; variability in shrub volume was also
   higher on east-facing than west-facing surfaces. Shrub spacing on alluvial flat and fan skirt surfaces (2.418 and
    2.333m, respectively) were larger than older alluvial fan, fan piedmont and fan remnant surfaces (1.776, 1.837 and 1.892m, respectively). Results show a significant relationship between spacing and canopy volume by aspect and by geomorphic surface. <br>
**Conclusions** – Results highlight the value of remote sensing for characterizing the biota, soils, and geological setting of remote desert valleys, especially when field work is not possible.
