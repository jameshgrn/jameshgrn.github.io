[Master's Project: Facies Character and Morphology of an Eocene Terminal Splay Complex, Uinta Basin, Utah](/Uinta)

**Project description:** Lacustrine deltas call for careful interpretation as they are distinct from their marine
counterparts. Lacustrine delta-fronts are dominated by shallow, low-relief sandy channels which drive sheet-sand
deposition basin-ward. Furthermore, lake base level can change meters over short time scales (100s of years
) leading to high-frequency progradational and retrogradational sequences. The Sunnyside Delta Interval—200m
interval of 10 fluvio-lacustrine sequences (Keighley et al., 2002 & 2003)—of the Middle Green River Fm. has been
thoroughly studied but the nature of the sediment delivery mechanism to Eocene Lake Uinta remains hotly debated in
the literature. Previous workers have classified the interval as a Fluvially-Dominated Delta (Remy, 1991; Schomacker
 et al., 2010), a Fluvial Fan (Wang, 2019), and a Terminal Splay (Pusca Doctoral Thesis, 2003). I believe that the
 Sunnyside Delta Interval most resembles a Terminal Splay Complex (after Fisher et al., 2008) based on facies
 character and morphology.

**Project description:** There are many publicly available lake-level data sets in varying states of accessibility
, upkeep, and accuracy (USGS, HydroWeb, Copernicus Global Land Service, NASA, NOAA, and various publications) The
 collating of data from disparate sources, or da- ta-wrangling, is often the barrier to entry for many scienific projects. Lake water level data particularly suffers from lack of ease of access as it is distributed haphazard- ly across federal, state, and academic databases. We aim to provide an open-source, well documented, scalable, modular, and regularly updated database of lake water levels and a python package of lacustrine analysis tools for use by researchers across disciplines and institutions. There are far more databases administered at the municipal and state level than is possible to include in this project, therefore a user-friendly, documented workflow for easily adding additional datasets via forking on GitHub will be a key component of this project.
Additionally, users will be able to modify or add functionalities to the “LakePy” python package for further
 flexibility and power. “LakePy” along with a set of standard remote sensing analytical capabilities will include an
  original sedimentation analysis toolkit to assess the “net sedimentation state” of a lake over a user-defined time
   period. Removing hurdles between researchers and available data is imperative in an increasingly data-rich world
   . Many researchers have immense subject-matter expertise regarding the biological, hydrological, and sedimentological nuances of lacustrine environments but little or no experience in automated querying, data cleaning/wrangling, or programming.
