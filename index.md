 I study sedimentary landscape organization and response to perturbations across scales, focusing on the patterns, thresholds, and transitions that emerge from fundamental physical processes. By quantifying spatial and temporal relationships in alluvial systems, I investigate how landscapes maintain, destabilize, and reestablish their structure. My data-driven approach seeks to uncover mechanistic controls on sedimentary and alluvial landscape processes, advancing both theoretical understanding and hazard prediction.

The Earth sciences is currently transitioning from a data-poor field to a data-rich one. I use geospatial data engineering and applied data science—largely through the lens of remote sensing—to investigate classic problems in geomorphology and sedimentology. 

#### Key Research Areas:

1. **Natural Hazards under Climate Change**: Investigating river avulsions and their impact on flooding and infrastructure. Recent avulsions in India alone have displaced millions and damaged agricultural and transportation infrastructure.

2. **Ecogeomorphology**: Analyzing the interplay between geomorphology and vegetation patterns through big-data approaches. My work includes the largest analysis of creosote shrub distributions to date (~23 million samples).

3. **Data Engineering & Machine Learning in Geosciences**: 
   - Developing novel applications of ICESat-2 data for floodplain topography
   - Creating BASED (Boost-Assisted Stream Estimator for Depth)
   - Building infrastructure for Army Corps of Engineers levee analysis
   - Designing LakePy for global lake water level analysis
