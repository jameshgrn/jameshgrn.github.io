### Project Overview

This research represents the largest analysis of creosote bush (*Larrea tridentata*) to date, examining approximately 23 million individual shrubs. The study investigates how landscape position and local-scale geomorphic features influence canopy volume and shrub spacing in a desert alluvial fan environment.

### Key Findings

- **Aspect Effects**: East-facing surfaces host shrubs up to 5X larger than west-facing surfaces
- **Surface Age Impact**: Older surfaces exhibit lower interspecific spacing
- **Threshold Identification**: Discovered transition point between biotic and abiotic control mechanisms
- **Spacing Patterns**: Documented significant variations across different geomorphic surfaces

### Technical Approach

- Remote sensing and ground-truthing
- Analysis of 23 million individual shrubs
- Statistical methods:
  - K-S testing
  - Distribution fitting
  - Generalized linear models (GLMs)
- Geomorphic surface classification

### Results

- **Canopy Volumes**:
  - Highest median on east-facing surfaces: 0.758m³
  - Lowest median on WNW-facing surfaces: 0.152m³
  - Higher variability on east-facing surfaces

- **Shrub Spacing**:
  - Alluvial flat surfaces: 2.418m
  - Fan skirt surfaces: 2.333m
  - Older surfaces: 1.776m - 1.892m
