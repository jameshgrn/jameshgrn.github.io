## Study Overview

### Research Objectives
1. Present a novel, unified sequence stratigraphic model for hydrologically closed (endorheic) basins: the Supply-Generated Sequence (SGS) Model
2. Interpret outcrop-based correlation of the Sunnyside Interval member of the middle Green River Formation
3. Correlate regional sequences at higher resolution than previous interpretations
4. Investigate the climatic origin of cyclic deposits and their relationship to early Eocene hyperthermal events

### Methods
1. **Outcrop-based Correlation**
   - Correlated 22 measured sections across ~30 km of outcrop
   - Used previous published stratigraphic sections
   - Added new bed-scale observations
   - Employed drone-based photogrammetry (DJI Mavic Pro II)
   - Used Agisoft Pro Metashape software for analysis

2. **Facies Analysis**
   - Identified 16 distinct facies
   - Analyzed sedimentological characteristics
   - Documented depositional environments

## Key Findings

### The Supply-Generated Sequence Model
- Divides packages of genetic lacustrine strata by bounding correlative surfaces
- Separates facies based on clastic supply:
  - Low supply: carbonates, mudstones, exposure surfaces
  - High supply: subaerial channelized sandstones, subaqueous siltstones, pedogenic mudstones
- Characteristically transgressive
- Greatest clastic deposition during lake-level rise

### Temporal Patterns
- Sequence durations: 40-50 kyr
- Aligns with early Eocene transitory hyperthermal events
- Links to regional climatic shifts
- Associated with increased riverine discharge

### Climate-Sediment Relationships
- Increased sediment discharge during hyperthermal events
- Corresponding water influx causes lake-level rise
- Results in increased clastic deposition
- Creates distinct sequence boundaries

## Impact & Applications

### Scientific Implications
- Provides new framework for interpreting closed lacustrine systems
- Links climate events to sedimentary records
- Improves understanding of endorheic basin dynamics
- Offers higher-resolution correlation methods

### Practical Applications
- Better interpretation of ancient lake deposits
- Improved understanding of climate-sediment relationships
- Enhanced correlation of lacustrine sequences
- Framework for studying modern closed basins
