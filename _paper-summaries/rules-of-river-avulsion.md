## Study Overview

### Research Objectives
1. Quantify topography around avulsing rivers and test classical avulsion mechanisms
2. Identify vulnerable rivers and predict avulsion paths
3. Develop a probabilistic prediction model for avulsion pathfinding
4. Assess implications for hazard management

### Methods
1. **Global Avulsion Dataset**
   - Compiled 174 globally distributed river avulsions
   - Used Landsat satellite images (1984-present)
   - Focused on recent, observable events

2. **Topographic Analysis**
   - Used ICESat-2 and FABDEM for measurements
   - Analyzed recently avulsed rivers
   - Quantified floodplain and channel geometry

3. **Pathfinding Model**
   - Developed random walk model
   - Incorporated topographic slope and flow inertia
   - Used softmax function and cosine similarity

4. **Channel Depth Estimation**
   - Created BASED (Boost-Assisted Stream Estimator for Depth)
   - Used XGBoost regressor
   - Incorporated RiverATLAS dataset

## Key Findings

### Spatial Patterns
- 74% of avulsions occur within 15% of normalized distance to mountain fronts or shorelines
- Distribution shows bimodal pattern: concentrated near mountain fronts and shorelines
- Avulsion frequency and style vary systematically from source to sink

### Physical Parameters
1. **Superelevation (β)**
   - Decreases from source to sink
   - ≥1 near source
   - <0.1 in distal settings
   - Higher on alluvial/fluvial fans

2. **Gradient Advantage (γ)**
   - Increases from source to sink
   - Ranges from 1 to ~32
   - Higher in deltaic settings
   - Inversely related to β

3. **Shear Stress Advantage (A)**
   - Median value: 2.1
   - Represents ratio of shear stress on alluvial ridge flank to main channel
   - Key threshold for avulsion occurrence

### Model Performance
- Successfully identified multiple pathways in test cases
- Avulsions tend to follow steeper paths
- Minimizes directional changes on floodplain

## Impact & Applications

### Scientific Implications
- Challenges classical assumptions about uniform avulsion behavior
- Provides quantitative framework for avulsion prediction
- Links local processes to global patterns

### Practical Applications
- Improved flood hazard prediction
- Better infrastructure planning
- Enhanced delta management
- More accurate risk assessment in Global South

## Technical Details

### Key Relationships
1. **β-γ Correlation**
   - Strong negative correlation
   - Product determines avulsion threshold
   - Varies systematically with landscape position

2. **Spatial Patterns**
   - Bimodal distribution of avulsions
   - Concentration near mountain fronts and shorelines
   - Systematic changes in avulsion style

### Model Components
1. **Random Walk Algorithm**
   - Incorporates topographic slope
   - Accounts for flow inertia
   - Uses softmax function for path selection

2. **BASED Model**
   - Machine learning approach
   - Estimates channel depth
   - Uses discharge, slope, and width data
