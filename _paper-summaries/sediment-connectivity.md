## Study Overview

### Research Objectives
1. Investigate connection between lacustrine deltaic clinothem growth and sub-lacustrine fan formation
2. Analyze stacking patterns and internal architectures of:
   - Lacustrine deltas
   - Sub-lacustrine fans
3. Reveal paleoclimatic signatures in different stratigraphic successions

### Methods
1. **3D Seismic Analysis**
   - Used GeoFrame Seiswork software
   - Analyzed stacking patterns
   - Mapped internal architectures

2. **Well Log Analysis**
   - Gamma ray (GR)
   - Acoustic (AC)
   - Spontaneous potential (SP)
   - Density (DEN)
   - Sonic logs

3. **Core Analysis**
   - Grain size distribution
   - Laser Diffraction Particle Size Analysis
   - Malvern Panalytical MS2000

4. **Geochemical Analysis**
   - X-Ray Fluorescence (ZSX Primus II)
   - ICP Mass Spectrometry (PE 350X)
   - Paleoclimatic proxies

## Key Findings

### Deltaic Clinothem Patterns
1. **Lower Succession**
   - Progradational to aggradational (PA) patterns
   - Flat to steeply rising rollover trajectories
   - Associated with:
     - Straight channels
     - Thick lobe complexes
     - Large-scale sub-lacustrine fans

2. **Upper Succession**
   - Aggradational to progradational and degradational (APD) patterns
   - Slightly rising to flat and falling trajectories
   - Associated with:
     - Sinuous channels
     - Thin lobe complexes
     - Small-scale sub-lacustrine fans

### Paleoclimatic Controls
- Two distinct climatic stages in SQEd:
  1. **Earlier Stage (Lower Succession)**
     - Humid conditions
     - Higher sediment supply
     - Efficient sediment transport
     - Large-scale fan development

  2. **Later Stage (Upper Succession)**
     - Semi-arid conditions
     - Reduced sediment supply
     - Less efficient transport
     - Smaller-scale fan development

## Impact & Applications

### Scientific Implications
- Novel insights into lacustrine delta-fan connectivity
- Contrasts with marine systems:
  - PA clinothems → large fans (lacustrine)
  - APD clinothems → large fans (marine)
- Climate's pivotal role in deep-lacustrine deposition

### Practical Applications
- Improved understanding of:
  - Lacustrine reservoir architecture
  - Sediment transport in closed basins
  - Climate-sediment relationships
- Enhanced exploration strategies

## Technical Details

### Study Location
- Bozhong Sag, Bohai Bay Basin, China
- Regional-scale study
- Oligocene age
- Closed lacustrine system

### Key Relationships
1. **Climate-Sediment Supply**
   - Humid conditions → high supply
   - Semi-arid conditions → reduced supply
   - Controls fan architecture

2. **Delta-Fan Connectivity**
   - PA clinothems → straight channels
   - APD clinothems → sinuous channels
   - Reflects transport efficiency

3. **Paleoclimatic Indicators**
   - Cu/Sr, Ca/Mg ratios
   - U/Th, Co/Fe ratios
   - C-value analysis
