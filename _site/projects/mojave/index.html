<p>This research represents the largest analysis of creosote bush (<em>Larrea tridentata</em>) to date, examining approximately 23 million individual shrubs. The study investigates how landscape position and local-scale geomorphic features influence canopy volume and shrub spacing in a desert alluvial fan environment.</p>

<h3 id="key-findings">Key Findings</h3>
<ul>
  <li>East-facing surfaces host shrubs up to 5X larger than west-facing surfaces</li>
  <li>Older surfaces exhibit lower interspecific spacing</li>
  <li>Discovered transition point between biotic and abiotic control mechanisms</li>
  <li>Documented significant variations across different geomorphic surfaces</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="technical-approach">Technical Approach</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Remote sensing and ground-truthing of 23 million samples</li>
  <li>Advanced statistical methods including K-S testing and GLMs</li>
  <li>Comprehensive geomorphic surface classification</li>
</ul>
