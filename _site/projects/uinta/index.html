<p>This research introduces a new, high-resolution correlation panel demonstrating the usefulness of a novel lacustrine sequence stratigraphic concept: the Supply-Generated Sequence (SGS). This work addresses fundamental inadequacies in previous sequence stratigraphic interpretations of lacustrine systems.</p>

<h3 id="project-overview">Project Overview</h3>
<p>An outcrop-based, near depositional-strike cross section of Uinta Basin fluvio-lacustrine interactions along the well-studied Nine Mile Canyon near Helper, Utah, highlights the strike variability of facies and depositional environments in the Sunnyside Interval deposits.</p>

<h3 id="key-findings">Key Findings</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Developed the Supply-Generated Sequence (SGS) concept</li>
  <li>Documented lateral complexity in sandstone event deposits</li>
  <li>Identified orbital forcing mechanisms in early Eocene Hyperthermal events</li>
  <li>Characterized the Sunnyside Interval System as a terminal “Supply-Controlled Splay Delta”</li>
</ul>
