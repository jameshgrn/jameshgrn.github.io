<p>My latest work involves an overlooked natural hazard: river avulsions. As seen in the figure, river avulsions occur when a river breaches its banks and begins to shift course on the floodplain. The resulting flooding can be some of the most intense on Earth, as the entire channel destabilizes catastrophically.</p>

<h3 id="key-findings">Key Findings</h3>
<p>I tested two 80-year-old ideas of avulsion initiation by quantifying the topography around avulsing rivers. This work demonstrated that these two mechanisms, historically invoked separately, work together. I further presented a novel theoretical framework that identifies which rivers are vulnerable to avulsion and predicts the path of an avulsing river.</p>
