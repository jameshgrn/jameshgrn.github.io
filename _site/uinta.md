### Project Overview

This research introduces a new, high-resolution correlation panel demonstrating the usefulness of a novel lacustrine sequence stratigraphic concept: the Supply-Generated Sequence (SGS). This work addresses fundamental inadequacies in previous sequence stratigraphic interpretations of lacustrine systems.

### Key Findings

- Developed the Supply-Generated Sequence (SGS) concept for lacustrine systems
- Documented lateral complexity in sandstone event deposits
- Characterized the Sunnyside Interval System as a terminal "Supply-Controlled Splay Delta"
- Identified orbital forcing mechanisms in early Eocene Hyperthermal events

### Technical Details

The research focused on:
- Outcrop-based, near depositional-strike cross sections
- High-resolution correlation panels
- Analysis of δ¹³C excursions
- Documentation of facies variability
