# James "Jake" Gearon

## Research Focus
I harness the data revolution to investigate statistical, morphodynamic, and scaling properties of sedimentary landscapes. My work combines industry-grade geospatial data engineering with applied data science to tackle fundamental questions in geomorphology and sedimentology.

### Current Research Themes

#### ðŸŒŠ Natural Hazards & Climate Change
- Leading research on river avulsions and flood prediction
- Developed novel theoretical framework for predicting vulnerable rivers and avulsion paths
- Published groundbreaking work in Nature (Gearon et al., 2024)

#### ðŸŒ± Ecogeomorphology
- Conducted largest-ever analysis of creosote shrub distributions (~23 million samples)
- Discovered significant relationships between surface age, hillslope aspect, and vegetation patterns
- Published in Gearon and Young (2021)

#### ðŸ’» Data Engineering & Machine Learning
- Developed BASED (Boost-Assisted Stream Estimator for Depth)
- Created novel applications of ICESat-2 data for floodplain topography
- Leading Army Corps of Engineers levee analysis infrastructure
