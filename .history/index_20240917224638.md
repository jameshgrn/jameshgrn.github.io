**Project description:** There are many publicly available lake-level datasets in varying states of accessibility, upkeep, and accuracy (USGS, HydroWeb, Copernicus Global Land Service, NASA, NOAA, and various publications). Collating data from disparate sources, or data-wrangling, is often the barrier to entry for many scientific projects. _Lake water level data particularly suffers from lack of ease of access as it is distributed haphazardly across federal, state, and academic databases._ ESIP, AWS, and I have collaborated to provide an open-source, well-documented, scalable, modular, and regularly updated database of lake water levels and a Python package [_LakePy_](http://lakepydocs.com.s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/) which acts as a Pythonic wrapper for the Global Lake Level Database API. Removing hurdles between researchers and available data is imperative in an increasingly data-rich world. Many researchers have immense subject-matter expertise regarding the biological, hydrological, and sedimentological nuances of lacustrine environments but little or no experience in automated querying, data cleaning/wrangling, or programming.
