excerpt: "Largest analysis of creosote bush distributions to date"

This research represents the largest analysis of creosote bush (*Larrea tridentata*) to date, examining approximately 23 million individual shrubs. The study investigates how landscape position and local-scale geomorphic features influence canopy volume and shrub spacing in a desert alluvial fan environment.

### Key Findings
- East-facing surfaces host shrubs up to 5X larger than west-facing surfaces
- Older surfaces exhibit lower interspecific spacing
- Discovered transition point between biotic and abiotic control mechanisms
- Documented significant variations across different geomorphic surfaces

### Technical Approach
- Remote sensing and ground-truthing of 23 million samples
- Advanced statistical methods including K-S testing and GLMs
- Comprehensive geomorphic surface classification
