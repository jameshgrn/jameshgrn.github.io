This research introduces a new, high-resolution correlation panel demonstrating the usefulness of a novel lacustrine sequence stratigraphic concept: the Supply-Generated Sequence (SGS). This work addresses fundamental inadequacies in previous sequence stratigraphic interpretations of lacustrine systems.

### Project Overview
An outcrop-based, near depositional-strike cross section of Uinta Basin fluvio-lacustrine interactions along the well-studied Nine Mile Canyon near Helper, Utah, highlights the strike variability of facies and depositional environments in the Sunnyside Interval deposits.

### Key Findings
- Developed the Supply-Generated Sequence (SGS) concept
- Documented lateral complexity in sandstone event deposits
- Identified orbital forcing mechanisms in early Eocene Hyperthermal events
- Characterized the Sunnyside Interval System as a terminal "Supply-Controlled Splay Delta"
