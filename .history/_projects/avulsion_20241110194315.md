excerpt: "Novel theoretical framework for predicting river avulsions"
collection: projects
---

My latest work involves an overlooked natural hazard: river avulsions. As seen in the figure, river avulsions occur when a river breaches its banks and begins to shift course on the floodplain. The resulting flooding can be some of the most intense on Earth, as the entire channel destabilizes catastrophically.

### Key Findings
I tested two 80-year-old ideas of avulsion initiation by quantifying the topography around avulsing rivers. This work demonstrated that these two mechanisms, historically invoked separately, work together. I further presented a novel theoretical framework that identifies which rivers are vulnerable to avulsion and predicts the path of an avulsing river.

### Technical Innovation
The research leveraged:
- State-of-the-art digital elevation models
- Novel applications of ICESat-2 (space-borne lidar platform)
- BASED (Boost-Assisted Stream Estimator for Depth) model
- Advanced geospatial data engineering pipelines
