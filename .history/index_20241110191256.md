### Research Focus

My research harnesses the ongoing data revolution to investigate the statistical, morphodynamic, and scaling properties of sedimentary landscapes: particularly rivers, deltas, and lakes. The goal of this approach is to develop predictive models of complex natural phenomena, which is crucial in the context of natural hazards in a warming world.

The Earth sciences is currently transitioning from a data-poor field to a data-rich one. I use industry-grade geospatial data engineering and applied data science—largely through the lens of remote sensing—to investigate classic problems in geomorphology and sedimentology. My recent work on predicting river avulsions demonstrates how this approach can result in high-impact science with broad appeal.

Key Research Areas:

1. **Natural Hazards under Climate Change**: Investigating river avulsions and their impact on flooding and infrastructure. Recent avulsions in India alone have displaced millions and damaged agricultural and transportation infrastructure.

2. **Ecogeomorphology**: Analyzing the interplay between geomorphology and vegetation patterns through big-data approaches. My work includes the largest analysis of creosote shrub distributions to date (~23 million samples).

3. **Data Engineering & Machine Learning in Geosciences**: 
   - Developing novel applications of ICESat-2 data for floodplain topography
   - Creating BASED (Boost-Assisted Stream Estimator for Depth)
   - Building infrastructure for Army Corps of Engineers levee analysis
   - Designing LakePy for global lake water level analysis
