# Open Notes & Ideas

This is my digital garden - a collection of notes, ideas, and work-in-progress thoughts from my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vault. These documents are often drafted and refined with the help of Large Language Models (LLMs), so expect a mix of polished thoughts and experimental musings.

⚠️ **Note**: These are living documents that I work on publicly. They may contain:
- Incomplete thoughts
- LLM-generated drafts
- Work-in-progress ideas
- Potential inaccuracies or speculative content

## Current Notes

I believe in working in public and sharing ideas early, even if they're not fully formed. Feel free to explore, but approach with appropriate skepticism!
